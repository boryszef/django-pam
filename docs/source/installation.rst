Installation
************

The easiest way to install the Django PAM package is with pip::

  $ pip install django-pam

You can also install with GitHub. This is useful if you need to see
Django PAM running in a real environment::

  $ git clone https://github.com/cnobile2012/django-pam.git

.. note::

  Be aware that the pip requirements in the GitHub repository are not
  frozen. This may cause Django PAM to break if dependencies are used
  that are much newer than what I used. If this happens, please put
  an issue in my GitHub account to let me know.
