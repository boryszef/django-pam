Installation
************

The easiest way to install the Django PAM package is with pip::

  $ pip install django-pam

You can also install with GitHub. This is useful if you need to see
Django PAM running in a real environment::

  $ git clone https://github.com/cnobile2012/django-pam.git

.. note::

  Be aware that the pip requirements in the GitHub repository are not
  frozen. This may cause Django PAM to break if used dependencies that
  are much newer than what I used. If this happens to you please put a
  issue in my GitHub account.

If you want to put the current master branch into your project with
pip do the following::

  $ pip install git+https://github.com/cnobile2012/django-pam.git
