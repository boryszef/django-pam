Welcome to Django PAM's documentation!
======================================

This is a simple backend that uses the *python-pam* package found at
`python-pam <https://github.com/FirefighterBlu3/python-pam>`_. Django
PAM can be used in an SSO (Single Sign On) environment or just on a
single box where you want to log into a Django app with the UNIX
login.
