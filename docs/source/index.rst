Welcome to Django PAM's documentation!
======================================

This is a simple authentication backend that uses the
`python-pam <https://github.com/FirefighterBlu3/python-pam>`_
package. Django PAM can be used in an SSO (Single Sign On) environment
or just with a single box where you want to log into a Django app with
your UNIX login.
