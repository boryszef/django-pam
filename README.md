# django-pam

A Django PAM authentication backend implementation.

## Overview

This is a simple backend that uses the *python-pam* package found at https://github.com/FirefighterBlu3/python-pam!. It can be used in a SSO (Single Sign On) environment or just on a single box where you want to log into a Django app with the UNIX login.

## Direction I hope to take with this project.

 1. A Dajngo authentication backend plugin.
 2. Login and Logout views.
